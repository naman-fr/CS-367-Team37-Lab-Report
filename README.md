# CS663 - Artificial Intelligence Lab

This repository contains the solutions and source code for the lab assignments of the CS663 Artificial Intelligence course (Autumn 2025-26) at IIIT Vadodara. The work is submitted by Group 37.

[cite_start]**Course Instructor:** Pratik Shah [cite: 9, 10]

## About This Project

This project involves implementing and analyzing various AI algorithms to solve a range of challenging problems. The assignments are designed to provide hands-on experience with concepts taught in the course. Each solution is a practical application of core AI principles, from classical search to modern machine learning techniques.

### Key Topics Covered:
* [cite_start]**Classical and Heuristic Search:** Solving puzzles like the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, 8-Puzzle, and Rabbit Leap using algorithms like BFS, DFS, and A*. [cite: 42, 66]
* [cite_start]**Local Search and Optimization:** Applying local search techniques (Hill-Climbing, Beam Search) and Simulated Annealing to combinatorial problems like k-SAT and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). [cite: 174, 193]
* [cite_start]**Probabilistic Reasoning:** Building Bayesian Networks and Hidden Markov Models to analyze data and make predictions under uncertainty. [cite: 211, 225]
* [cite_start]**Reinforcement Learning:** Exploring sequential decision-making and learning from interaction with an environment, including n-armed bandits and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). [cite: 289, 309]

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by assignment number, with each folder containing the source code and any necessary data files for that lab.

-   [cite_start]**/Assignment1**: Solutions for Missionaries & Cannibals and Rabbit Leap problems. [cite: 46, 51]
-   [cite_start]**/Assignment2**: A* search implementation for Puzzle-8 and a plagiarism detector. [cite: 74, 81]
-   [cite_start]**/Assignment3**: Solvers for Marble Solitaire and random 3-SAT problems. [cite: 166, 173]
-   [cite_start]**/Assignment4**: Simulated Annealing solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Jigsaw Puzzles. [cite: 189, 202]
-   ... and so on for all assignments.

## Lab Reports

[cite_start]The project also includes two comprehensive reports detailing the problem statements, methodologies, results, and conclusions for each set of assignments. [cite: 27] [cite_start]The reports are formatted using the IEEE Transactions template as required by the course. [cite: 29]

**Note on Academic Integrity:** This code is intended for reference purposes. [cite_start]Plagiarism is strictly prohibited in this course, and any submitted work found to be copied will receive zero credit. [cite: 37]
